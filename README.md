# Letter

This is a personal font made using [Iosevka Customizer](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/customizer). It was important to me
that the l was distinguishable from the L and I and that 0 is not dotted but striped. Then I made some small
adjustments that were easy to do since I was working on it anyway. 

For terminals, I prefer `Letter Extended`. The rest of my machine uses `Letter`.

I might try to make this into a package at some point.
